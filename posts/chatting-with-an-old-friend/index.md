Mikeal Rogers passed away yesterday. We weren't especially close but he had a profound impact on my life and was always very kind to me. One of my favorite tweets of all time was from him, when I gave a talk as a young kid about how cool Chrome DevTools were and the Chrome DevTools team showed up unexpectedly to watch.

He was a hugely influenctial person. His work on Node.js, TC39, web3, has been foundational to the web we have today.

I was reading Jenn Schiffer's Bluesky post about him when I realized I had also recorded a podcast with Mikeal, way back in the day.

## The Web Behind

I had started this podcast called The Web Behind to interview developers I knew (mostly in SF) and ask them about how they got their start. It was really fun for me getting to know people and hearing their diverse stories. I went to go to my [old website](https://webbehind.com/) to listen to the episode with Mikeal but there was a problem.

That's annoying, but then I figured I could use the way back machine to find it!

I found a snapshot of the old site, and found the link for the episode! But there was no audio embed!

That's ok, I opened the Chrome Devtools and found the embed link! It's for a Soundcloud file. But when I clicked on it, it just redirect to the Soundcloud home page. At least I had a lead...

I searched Soundcloud for "web behind" and I found the page! But strangely, there were only 4 episodes on there and Mikeal's wasn't one of them. Even stranger, the right sidebar said "8 tracks" but I could only see 4. I wondered if I could still get into that account.

I went to soundcloud and logged in with my email address. Had to reset it multiple times since I had missed multiple security breaches while I'd been gone. I finally got in only to find that email address did not own the web behind account.

I searched a few times to see if there was any way to figure out what email address a channel belonged to but obviously that would be a terrible thing for Soundcloud to do so I was stuck.

## A lucky break

I was clicking all around, trying old email addresses, looking at my web hosting to see all the email accounts I've ever created but having no luck. I kept trying things like `jon@webbehind.com` or `admin@webbehind.com`. One nice thing is that Soundcloud lets you know after you enter just an email address whether it's associated with an account or not. No luck.

I was playing around with Postman to see if I could scrape any information when I caught a break! It turns out that I had linked my Soundcloud account to iTunes and the iTunes email address is listed in the RSS feed!

I couldn't guess the gmail password but as luck would have it, I did set up my real email address as the backup for the account, so I was able to reset it!

With that, I was able to reset my Soundcloud password and log in! At first I had no luck, I was still only able to see the 4 public episodes. But then I noticed on the Insights page if I zoomed out I could see traffic to Mikeal's episode from years ago. Eventually I figured out what had happened!

## A bargain at any price

All I needed to do was give Soundcloud $10 for whatever Soundcloud Artist is and download the episode!

## It's nice to hear your voice

Thanks for the puzzle, Mikeal. It's nice to hear your voice again.
