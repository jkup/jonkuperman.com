<h1>Hi friends!</h1>
<p>
    I'm Jon Kuperman. I work as an engineer for Bloomberg! I've had the priviledge of working for some amazing
    companies like Cloudflare, Adobe, Brave, Twitter and Barracuda Networks. My career has gone from web development
    (12 years) to Developer Evangalism and now I work on C++ and TypeScript infrastructure! I record workshops on
    <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/chrome-dev-tools-v2/">
        Chrome DevTools
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-accessibility/">Accessibility</a>
    over at
    <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/jon-kuperman/">Frontend Masters</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I post a lot about JavaScript and the web here on
    <a href="https://jonkuperman.com/">jonkuperman.com</a>. I also am very active on
    <a href="https://twitter.com/jkup">Twitter</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I also help organize the amazing
    <a href="https://www.jsconfhi.com/">JSConf Hawai ªi</a> with some other
    <a href="https://www.jsconfhi.com/organizers/">amazing folks</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I love giving conference talks, making videos, writing blog posts and hanging out
    chatting with other devs! If you have a project or event you think I'd be a good
    fit for, feel free to contact me at jon [dot] kuperman [at] gmail [dot] com.
